# Jacho
Jacho is a framework for echo state computing, built on Jax. Its name is a combination of Jax and Echo - Jacho.

## What does it do?
We've currently implemented the following models:
* Reservoir Computing (RC)
* Structured Reservoir Computing (SRC)

We're working on expanding it to other models, and we welcome PRs.

**Why Jax?** Jax has several benefits for RC. First, its functional nature and how to deal with states and random numbers makes it very natural to work with. Second (and third, fourth, ...), it's really fast. 

## How to install
Right now we only support installation through pip. Clone the repository change into it and run

```
pip install .
```

 to install the package. If you're developing, install it using 
 
 ```
 pip install -e .
 ```
 
 so you can change the source code.
